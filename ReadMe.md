## Purpose

This is a project to chart running a [Vertx](http://vertx.io) Verticle connecting to Domino.

Using a Notes Client as the interface, it can only run as the current Notes ID logged on. Using a Domino server, it runs as the server ID or any other user.

The process is tracked via the feature branches.

## Using

Import the project into Eclipse. Right-click the relevant Java files and choose Run As > Application. Next steps will be to work out how to run from command line.
